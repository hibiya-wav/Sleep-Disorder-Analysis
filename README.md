# Sleep Disorder Analysis

An Independent Analysis done in collaboration with my colleagues, Isaiah Auguste and Anthony Dvorsky aims to provide an exploration of sleep disorders using ML techniques. Our methodology encompasses 4 key tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Training, Testing and Evaluation, and Model Comparison.

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

My team and I selected a dataset from an open data portal in the US and ensured it comprised of a minimum of 10 features, with at least one categorical and one numerical feature. First, we explained the dataset by providing a detailed analysis of each feature, highlighting aspects such as distribution and statistics. In cases where the dataset comprises of an extensive number of features, we prioritized the most significant ones and presented a concise summary of the remaining attributes. When demonstrating the insights of the data, we included proper visualizations and ensured good quality and standards in our graphs. We then selected the most important features to train our model.

### Task 2: Model Training

In this step, we initiated the process by defining the type of machine learning problem we are addressing, such as classification or regression. We trained two models using identical training data, each incorporating a minimum of three features, with one of these features being categorical.

**Classification question: Does the provided set of categories and their corresponding values accurately determine whether an individual has a sleep disorder or not?**

### Task 3: Testing and Evaluation

Here, we tested both models in use, using our test data with mathematical equations used in Data Analysis to test if these models perform well (F1 Score, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix).

### Task 4: Model Comparison

My team and I compared the outcomes of both models and engaged in a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each. We then delved into how each model navigated the provided data, and if performance was suboptimal, as well as provided an insightful analysis of the reasons behind it.

All work is done on Google Colab. So if you want to run this, I recommend you clone this repo and run them independently on your own Colab notebook/machine. 

(You may have to fix the link on where the data is stored because accessing csv files on Google Colab can be a bit hackey).
